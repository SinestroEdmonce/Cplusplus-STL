# Cplusplus-STL
The SGI STL source code, downloaded from the official organization website, is stored on the Github for further learning and understanding Cplusplus.

## Books Recommended
There are several books that analyze the STL source code and besides, attempt to explain some coding methods used in the source code.  
Those books have been stored in `./Books/` and now shared together.

## Future Work
Perhaps with the learning going much further and deeper, I wish to implement a simple Cplusplus STL by myself. However, it all depends on my time and learning schedule. We will see!
